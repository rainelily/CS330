# CS330

When I design software, I usually start with a rough idea of what I want the end result to look or feel like, and then I figure out how to make it happen piece by piece. This project pushed me to think more about design from a technical side instead of just visually. I had to consider how everything fit together—how the lighting affected materials, how positioning changed the mood, and how even small details could change the whole feel of the scene.

My process was pretty hands-on. I’d test something, realize it looked off, tweak it, and keep going until it felt right. It wasn’t a straight path, but the constant trial and error actually helped me understand things better. I’ll definitely take that approach with future projects, especially ones that need both creativity and problem-solving.

When it came to coding, I tried to stay organized but flexible. I worked in chunks, tested constantly, and focused on understanding why things worked instead of just copying what looked right. My mindset changed a lot over the milestones. At first, I just wanted things to show up on screen, but by the end, I cared more about how it all came together as a finished piece.

Overall, this class helped me see how computer science connects logic and creativity. Working with computational graphics gave me a better appreciation for how code can bring visual ideas to life. I can see these skills being useful anywhere that design and tech overlap—whether that’s game dev, interactive media, or just future creative projects I take on for fun.
